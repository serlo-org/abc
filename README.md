## Updating Create React Native App and React Native

Updating the `react-native-scripts` dependency of your app should be as simple as bumping the version number in `package.json` and reinstalling your project's dependencies.

Upgrading to a new version of React Native requires updating the `react-native`, `react`, and `expo` package versions, and setting the correct `sdkVersion` in `app.json`. See the [versioning guide](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/VERSIONS.md) for up-to-date information about package version compatibility.

## Available Scripts

### `yarn install`

Installs the dependencies as specified in [package.json](package.json) according to the locked versions in [yarn.lock](yarn.lock).

### `yarn start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

### `yarn test`

Runs the [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) test runner on your tests.

### `yarn test -- --watch`

Runs the [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) test runner on your tests in watch mode.

### `yarn ios`

Like `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

### `yarn android`

Like `yarn start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup).

### `yarn format`

Formats all JavaScript code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier). 

## Writing and Running Tests

This project is set up to use [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for tests. Files with suffix `.test.js` will be loaded by jest. The [jest documentation](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/getting-started.html) is also a wonderful resource, as is the [React Native testing tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/tutorial-react-native.html).

## Tips and Tricks

* If you have a local network the prevents your phone from accessing the address that is printed when running the packager, you can often work around this issue by "tethering" your computer to your phone's internet connection. Some phones call this feature "mobile hotspot." While it's very convenient, if you have a data plan where you pay for data transfer you should be careful when using this feature, especially when installing dependencies from NPM.
